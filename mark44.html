        The Hulkbuster armor known as "Iron Man Mark 44" was featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) 
        and made its first appearance in the movie "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015). Keep in mind that there
        might be additional information or developments after this date.

        The Hulkbuster, officially designated as the "Veronica" armor in the MCU, was created by Tony Stark  
        as contingency plan to deal with threats posed by the Hulk, particularly in case Banner lost control 
        of his alter ego. Here are some key points about the Hulkbuster Mark 44:
                
        1. Design and Appearance:
            - The Hulkbuster is significantly larger and more heavily armored than regular Iron Man suits.
            - It features a modular design with various interchangeable parts, allowing it to adapt to 
              different combat situations.
                
        2. Purpose:
            - The primary purpose of the Hulkbuster is to contain and neutralize the Hulk, who  possesses 
              immense strength and poses a significant threat when in a state of rage.
                
        3. Special Features:
            - Enhanced Strength: The Hulkbuster is equipped with powerful hydraulic systems and enhanced 
              strength to match the Hulk's formidable physical abilities.
            - Extra Armor: The armor is heavily reinforced to withstand the incredible force and impact 
              of the Hulk's attacks.
            - Repulsor Technology: It is armed with repulsor technology similar to the standard suits.
                
        4. Deployment:
            - In "Avengers: Age of Ultron," Tony Stark activates the Hulkbuster armor to confront the Hulk 
              in the midst of a citywide battle.
                
        5. Veronica:
            - The name "Veronica" is a reference to the Archie Comics character, and it serves as the code 
              name for the Hulkbuster protocol.
                
        6. Subsequent Appearances:
            - The Hulkbuster armor has made subsequent appearances in other Marvel movies, including 
              "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018) and "Avengers: Endgame" (2019).
