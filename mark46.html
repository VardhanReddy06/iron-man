            <pre class="about">
        The Iron Man Mark 46 is a fictional powered exoskeleton suit appearing in comic books published by 
        Marvel Comics. It is also featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Here's some information 
        about the Mark 46 based on my last update:

        Comic Book Version:
        In the comics, the Mark 46 suit may not be as prominent as it is in the MCU. Iron Man's suits are 
        frequently updated and modified, and the numbering may not always follow a linear progression.
              
        Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Version:
        The Mark 46 suit first appears in the movie "Captain America: Civil War" (2016). In the MCU, Tony 
        Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) created the Mark 46 as an advancement over his previous Iron Man suits. 
        Here are some key features and events associated with the Mark 46 in the MCU:
              
        First Appearance: "Captain America: Civil War" (2016) - This suit is introduced during the conflict 
        between Captain America and Iron Man's factions of the Avengers.
              
        Capabilities: Like its predecessor, the Mark 46 is equipped with advanced technology,flightcapability, 
        repulsor blasts, and enhanced strength. It also features an advanced Heads-Up Display (HUD) and 
        improved durability.
              
        Usage in "Civil War": The Mark 46 is prominently featured in the battle between Iron Man and Captain 
        America's forces. During the fight, it showcases its capabilities in combat against other 
        super-powered individuals.
              
        Relationship to Sokovia Accords: The conflict in "Civil War" arises from the Sokovia Accords, a legal 
        document that seeks to regulate and control the activities of superhuman individuals. Iron Man's support 
        for the Accords pits him against Captain America, who opposes them.

        Upgrades and Technology:

        The Mark 46 represents a continued evolution of Stark's Iron Man technology. It likely includes 
        advancements in materials, power sources, and AI integration compared to its predecessors.
